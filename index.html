  		<p class="content-name name1">DOROWOT</p>
  		<p class="content">Doro Wat is one of the most famous of all African dishes.  You will find it in every Ethiopian restaurant and virtually anyone who is familiar with African cuisine will have heard of it.Another version, though not as commonly known here,is Sega Wat, made with beef you’ll find recipes online calling it Sik Sik Wat, but I’ve confirmed with the chefs of several Ethiopian restaurants that it’s Sega Wat).You can directly substitute beef for chicken and follow the same cooking instructions.</p>

   		<p class="content-name name2">KITFO</p>
   		<p class="content">Kitfo cooked lightly rare is known as kitfo leb leb.Kitfo is often served alongside—sometimes mixed with—a mild cheese called ayibe or cooked greens known as gomen. In many parts of Ethiopia, kitfo is served with injera, a flatbread made from teff, although in traditional Gurage cuisine, one would use kocho, a thick flatbread made from the ensete plant. An ensete leaf may be used as a garnish. Though not considered a delicacy, kitfo is generally held in high regard.</p>

  		<p class="content-name name3">TIBS</p>
  		<p class="content">tibs is the name for one of the cooler Ethiopian dishes out there. It’s a hybrid stir fry and stew that comes together in an instant, is meaty, rich and can be spicy as hell. Served with bread, rice or, more properly, injera flatbread, it was and is my favorite Ethiopian dish. I always made it with lamb, but we also served it with beef — and now I use venison.</p>
